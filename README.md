# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple project that plays the game tic tac toe. 
The program will ask the users to enter there names and once entered the gameboard will be displayed on the screen. 
Once a winner has won or there is a draw the result will be displayed on screen. 

Topics Ive learned from this project: 

- Creating and learning the differences between constructors and factory functions. 
- Using IIFE, or Immediately Invoked Function Expressions to call on methods that would only need to be called once. 
- Using IIFE to limit the about of global variables seen in the scope. 
- Creating different divs to be displayed on the main screen and hiding the display of other divs when they arent needed.
